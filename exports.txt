### Using the Exports

This script provides several exports for use in other resources, allowing you to integrate the manual transmission system into your own scripts.

---

### 1. **Activate Manual Transmission**

**Description**: This export forces the manual transmission system to activate for the player's current vehicle.  
**Usage**: Can be called from another script when you want to switch the vehicle's transmission to manual.

**Code**:
```lua
-- Activate manual transmission for the player's current vehicle
exports['stick']:activateManualTransmission()
```

---

### 2. **Deactivate Manual Transmission**

**Description**: This export forces the manual transmission system to deactivate for the player's current vehicle, returning it to automatic mode.  
**Usage**: Call this when you want to disable manual transmission.

**Code**:
```lua
-- Deactivate manual transmission for the player's current vehicle
exports['stick']:ManualOff()
```

---

### 3. **Set Vehicle Transmission via Database (Automatic)**

**Description**: This export allows you to permanently set a vehicle to **automatic transmission** (using a `0` value) in the database based on the vehicle’s license plate.  
**Usage**: Can be used in scripts where you manage vehicle sales or other permanent transmission changes.

**Code**:
```lua
-- Set vehicle to automatic transmission (0)
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
local plate = GetVehicleNumberPlateText(vehicle)
exports['stick']:setVehicleTransmission(plate, 0)
```

---

### 4. **Set Vehicle Transmission via Database (Manual)**

**Description**: This export allows you to permanently set a vehicle to **manual transmission** (using a `1` value) in the database based on the vehicle’s license plate.  
**Usage**: Can be used for permanent changes such as installing manual transmissions in mechanic scripts or dealership scripts.

**Code**:
```lua
-- Set vehicle to manual transmission (1)
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
local plate = GetVehicleNumberPlateText(vehicle)
exports['stick']:setVehicleTransmission(plate, 1)
```

---

### Example Usage in a Mechanic Script

You can integrate the exports into any mechanic job script for transmission installation:

```lua
RegisterNetEvent('mechanic:installManualTransmission')
AddEventHandler('mechanic:installManualTransmission', function()
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
    local plate = GetVehicleNumberPlateText(vehicle)
    -- Mechanic installs manual transmission
    exports['stick']:setVehicleTransmission(plate, 1)
    print('Manual transmission installed!')
end)
```

---

### Notes

- Make sure the license plate text is valid and matches the vehicle in your database.
- If `Config.alwaysStick` is set to `true`, manual transmission will automatically be applied to all vehicles, regardless of the database.

---

### Future Enhancements

- Support for additional custom key mappings.
- Advanced clutch and shifting mechanics.
- Compatibility with specific vehicle types for better transmission control.
